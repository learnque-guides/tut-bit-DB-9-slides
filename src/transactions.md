# Transactions

* In a database, a transaction is simply a mchanism to ensure and verify that data gets to its intended destination. Just like a purchase or bank transaction, both parties must be satisfied with the results based upon some kind of pre-defined rule.
* A transaction defines the scope or context of one or more database actions.
* A transaction is a unit of work that might include multiple activities that query and modify data and that can also change the data definition.
